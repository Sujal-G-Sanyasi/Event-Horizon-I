# Event-Horizon-I

A simple astro-physics based repository where in we will see how much a quasar is destructive within the scale of a solar system.
It's real physics based solar system where it contains essentials like Newtonian gravitional motion, Kepler's orbital motion and Leapfrog that stabilises the velocity for stable orbital motion.

## Update Status:
- Will be available soon with a fully functional quasar that works under the laws of physics that including LSTM trained quasar for sequential time based behaviors and motion totally coded in physics i.e gravity and Space Time, Accretion physics and relativistic jet physics(if possible). The distance of solar system versus Quasar will be caalculate in Astronomical Units(AU) for more realistics annihilation of masses.
