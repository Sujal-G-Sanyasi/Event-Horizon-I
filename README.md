# Event-Horizon-I
Event Horizon-I models POX 5 Quasar a silent, drifting SMBH(Super Massive Black Hole) sliding into the Solar System’s edge. Its quasar pulses, tidal rifts, and Hill-sphere ruptures unravel planetary stability. ML and LSTM track the disrupt, predicting when orbits fail, light dims, and gravity begins pulling reality apart. A solid edge for WHAT IF?!
